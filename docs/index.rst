hardDecisions: A Package for modeling decision making trees using Python
===============================================================================



**Date**: June 22, 2018  **Version**: 0.0.1

**Binary Installers:** https://pypi.org/project/hardDecisions

**Source Repository**: https://github.com/jdvelasq/hardDecisions

**Documentation**: http://hardDecisions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

**hardDecisions** is an open source (distributed under the MIT license) and
friendly-user package to analyze decisions using the methodology of decision
trees. The package was developed and tested in Python
version 3.6. It can be installed from the command line using:

``$ pip install hardDecisions``

**hardDecisions** can be used interactively at the Python’s command prompt, but a better
experience is achieved when IPython or Jupyter’s notebook are used, allows the
user to fully document the analysis and draw conclusions. Due to the design of
the package, it is easy to use hardDecisions with the tools available in the ecosystem
of open source tools for data science.

**hardDecisions** is well suited for decision analysis and it can be used to:

* Easily specify the structure of decision trees and compute expected values.

* Realize scenario analysis where the value associated to each path of events
  and decisions is calculated using user functions written in Python.

* Compute the expected value of each path of decisions.

* Compute expected utility using different utility functions.

* Compute the risk profile of a set of decisions.

* Analyze different types of loans.

* Compute assets depreciation.

* Realize cashflow analysis.
